title: "Relationship between Life Expectancy and Country Population"

Next, I will visualize the relationship between `life_expectancy` and `population_millions`.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, readr, ggplot2)
gapminder <- read_csv("./gapminder.csv")

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-lifepop
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig.cap: "This is a scatter plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and country population"

ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=population_millions, y=life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Relationship Between Life Expectancy and Country Population",
       x="Population (Millions)",
       y="Life Expectancy (years)")

```

In @fig-lifepop you can see the relationship between these variables.
