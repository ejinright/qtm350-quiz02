title: "Relationship between Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita"
---

To begin analysis, I will first visualize the relationship between `life_expectancy` and `gdp_per_capita`

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, readr, ggplot2)
gapminder <- read_csv("./gapminder.csv")

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-lifegdp
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig.cap: "This is a scatter plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and gdp per capita"

ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=gdp_per_capita, y=life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Relationship Between Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita",
       x="GDP per Capita (Dollars)",
       y="Life Expectancy (years)")

```

In @fig-lifegdp you can see the relationship between these variables.
